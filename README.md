# TwistChallengeModule3
This repository contains my codes  for my twist challenge module 3 on DSI AFrica 2022. In this project, I am analyzing how important is education in Africa according to the GDELT database. 

After querying the news from African countries over 10 years, I analyze the headlines to see if it is a positive new on education or not and I then compare each the result for each year.
